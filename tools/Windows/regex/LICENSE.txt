IMPORTANT - READ CAREFULLY

This license statement and limited warranty constitutes a legal agreement ("License Agreement") between you ("Licensee", either as an individual or a single entity) and Just Great Software Co. Ltd. ("Licensor"), sole worldwide publisher of the software product RegexBuddy ("Software") of which Jan Goyvaerts is the copyright holder.

The Web Site referred to in this agreement is http://www.regexbuddy.com/

BY INSTALLING, COPYING, OR OTHERWISE USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE LICENSE AGREEMENT.

Upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of the License Agreement, Licensor grants you the right to use the Software in the manner provided below.

If you do not accept the terms and conditions of the License Agreement, you must promptly delete each and any copy of the Software from all your computers and removable devices.

The Licensor reserves the right to license the same Software to other individuals or entities under a different license agreement.

The Licensee must purchase a single user license or a multi-user license from the Licensor.  This license bears the name of the licensed person or entity and is not transferable to any other party.  The purchase price for the license is a one-time fee in accordance with the pricing schedule set forth on the Web Site at the time of purchase.

If the Licensee has not purchased a license, or if the Licensee's payment is refunded to Licensee, Licensee is not permitted to use the Software and Licensee must promptly delete each and any copy of the Software from any and all of Licensee's computers.

If a single user license was bought, the Licensee has the option of creating a single installation of the Software used by one or more persons, or creating multiple installations of the Software used exclusively by a single person.  Any combination of these options, or installing the Software on a network server, is not permitted.

If a multi-user license was bought, the Licensee may install the Software in one of three possible ways.  (1) The Licensee may create as many installations of the Software as the number of users the license is valid for, regardless of the number of people using those installations, provided that each of the installations can be used by only one person at a time; or (2) the Licensee may install the Software on one or more network servers on the condition that the number of client computers that have access to the Software installed on that server or those servers, is equal to or less than the number of users the license is valid for; or (3) the Licensee may create any number of installations of the Software, provided that the number of people that have physical or electronic access to those installations is equal to or less than the number of users the license is valid for.  Any combination of these three alternatives is not permitted.  At any given time, the number of people who could possibly use the Software concurrently must be equal to or less than the number of users the license is valid for.  If the number of possible concurrent users grows, the Licensee must promptly buy additional licenses.

Licensee can create installations in two ways.  (1) Licensee can install the Software onto the fixed hard disk of a computer.  Each computer onto which Licensee installed the software counts as one installation.  Only one person must be able to use the Software installed onto the computer at any given time.  If multiple people can use the Software installed on the computer simultaneously, that computer shall be deemed a network server for the purposes of this license agreement.  (2) Licensee can install the software onto a removable disk, flash card, USB stick or other device.  This removable device allows the Software to be used by one person at a time on any computer into which the device can be inserted, without installing the Software on that computer.  Each removable disk, card or device onto which Licensee installed the software counts as one installation.

If Licensee installs the Software onto the fixed hard disks of one or more computers, and also onto one or more removable devices, the total number of installations is counted as the sum of the computers and the removable devices onto which Licensee installed the Software.

Regardless of the number of licenses bought, the Licensee has right to place an additional copy of the Software on a removable medium for backup purposes to protect the investment made.  This archival copy does not count as an installation.

Technical support is available directly from the Licensor at no additional charge.  When encountering problems, the Licensee must first visit the Web Site and read the information presented there to make sure the question or problem is not already answered there.  The Licensee must also verify that the Licensee is using the latest version of the Software, either by using the "check new version" command in the Software, or by reading the version history on the Web Site.  If the Licensee has the latest version and the question is not answered on the web site, the licensee may write to technical support email address with his question in either the English or Dutch language.

The Software includes functionality to connect to a Forum operated by the Licensor.  While the connection technology is part of the Software, the actual Forum is not part of the Software.  Acceptance of this license for the Software does not grant the Licensee any access rights to the Forum.  The Licensor may grant or deny the Licensee partial or complete access for reading and/or writing to the Forum at the Licensor's sole discretion.  The Licensor may revoke or reinstate Licensee's at any given time, at the Licensor's sole discretion.  The Licensee can determine the Licensee's Forum access by attempting to use the Software as licensed by Licensee to connect to the Forum.  The Licensee must not attempt to circumvent Forum restrictions by any means, including but not limited to using other people's copies of the Software.  Although the Licensor may restrict access to the Forum, the Forum is operated as a public discussion area.  The Licensor cannot be expected to protect the privacy or copyright of messages posted to the Forum by the Licensee against 3rd parties.  All Forum participants will be fully liable for their own actions on the Forum, and only their own actions.  The Licensor may post additional rules and guidelines that govern the Forum on the Forum.  The Licensor's sole means of enforcing these additional rules shall be to grant or deny access to the Forum, and to delete messages posted to the forum.  The Licensee can disregard these additional rules if Licensee does not access the Forum.

The Software is provided "as is". In no event shall the Licensor or any of the Licensor's affiliates be liable for any consequential, special, incidental, or indirect damages of any kind arising out of the delivery, performance or use of this Software, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.  While the Software has been developed with great care, it is not possible to warrant that the Software is error free.  The Software is not designed or intended to be used in any activity that may cause personal injury, death, or any other severe damage or loss.  Neither shall the Licensee be liable for any consequential, special, incidental, or indirect damages of any kind arising out of the use of this Software under the terms of this License Agreement.

When errors are found in the Software, the Licensor will release a new version of the Software that no longer contains those errors a reasonable amount of time after the Licensor is given an accurate description of those errors.  The amount of time considered reasonable will depend on the complexity and severity of the errors.  The Licensor will mention the release on the Web Site and, at the Licensor's option, directly contact the Licensee to announce the new release.  The Licensee can then, at their option, upgrade to the latest version or to continue to use the older version the Licensee already has.  In either case, no payment to the Licensor is required.  In the latter case, the Licensee will no longer be entitled to technical support until the Licensee has upgraded to the latest version.

The Licensor reserves the right to charge an upgrade fee in the case of major new enhancements or additions to the Software.  This major new version will then start a new version line that will use version numbers clearly distinguishable from the old version line.  The Licensee has no obligation to upgrade to the new version line and the Licensor will continue to make the latest version of the previous version line available for download to the Licensee at no additional charge.

The Licensor reserves the right to revoke the Licensee's license without prior notice if the Licensee violates any of the terms of this license agreement.

You must not attempt to reverse compile, modify, translate or disassemble the Software in whole or in part.  You must not run the Software under a debugger or similar tool allowing you to inspect the inner workings of the Software.

The Software remains the exclusive property of the Licensor.  Any Licensee who fully complies with the terms in this license agreement may use it according to the terms of this license agreement.  You must not give copies of the Software or your license key to other persons or entities.  You must not transfer the Software or your license key to another person or entity.  You must also take reasonable steps to prevent any third party from copying the software from one of your computers or removable devices without your permission.
